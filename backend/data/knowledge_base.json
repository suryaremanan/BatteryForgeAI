        "content": "In case of thermal runaway detection (Code E-99), immediate isolation of the battery pack is required. Do not attempt to cool with water unless explicitly authorized by the specific chemistry safety sheet. Evacuate the area to a radius of 50 meters. Use Class D fire extinguishers for lithium metal, but standard ABC extinguishers may be used for managing surrounding fires."

        "content": "Cell balancing should be performed when voltage delta exceeds 50mV. Passive balancing is automatically triggered by the BMS during charging cycles between 80% and 100% SOC. Active balancing requires the service tool connected via CAN bus. Ensure pack temperature is below 45°C before initiating active balancing."
